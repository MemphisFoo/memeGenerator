Project Pitch

- This project consists of a single page meme viewer. Users can navigate through the different memes by using the 'next' and 'previous' buttons, by clicking on the memes themselves, or by using the arrow keys. Users can add the currently displayed meme to their favorites, which will move it to a seperate area on the right of the page. Users can also toggle between light mode and dark mode.
